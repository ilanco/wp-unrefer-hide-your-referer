Hide your referer (referrer) on all external links with unrefer.com.

== Description ==

links on your blog using the unrefer.com service and effectively hides your site as origin of the referred link.

For example, Hide Referer for WordPress will convert an external link to wordpress.com, to [http://unrefer.com/?http://wordpress.org](http://unrefer.com/?http://wordpress.org).
